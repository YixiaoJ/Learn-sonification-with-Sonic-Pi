# Learn resource—‘sonification’ with Sonic Pi
## Listening to the weather

If you haven’t heard of [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) yet, it’s a brilliant sound synthesiser which runs on the Pi. It can support the learning of computing and also music.

This resource is about using Sonic Pi to ‘visualise’ data using sound; there’s a fancy name for this ‘sonification’. The aim is to use Sonic Pi, with help from another software package which is alo part of the standard Pi Raspbian software—Mathematica to take weather (temperature) data and turn it into sound . Why do this? The ear is very sensitive to changes, and can pick out trends in data which might not be immediately apparent just by looking at a sequence of numbers.

## What do I need?

To undertake this you will need:

- a Raspberry Pi model B/B+ with speakers (for example those in the TV you’re using as a display) or headphones plugged into the audio socket
- an internet connection, so the Pi can download data

There are two worksheets:

- getting started—hearing your first data set as sound
- another example—Antarctic climate

This resource is a re-working of an earlier blog post—[Hearing the weather-sonification in Sonic Pi](http://stevelloyd.net/notes/2014/06/23/hearing-the-weather-sonification-in-sonic-pi/) with modifications to suit changes in Mathematica.
